    <br>Solutions to HackerRank problems

This repository will contain my C++ implementations of the problems presented in [Hackerrank](www.hackerrank.com)

## [Forming a Magic Square](https://github.com/tknbr/hackerrank/blob/master/magicSquares.cc)

We define a magic square to be an NxN matrix of distinct positive integers from 1 to n^2 where the sum of any row, column, or diagonal of length n is always equal to the same number: the magic constant.
You will be given a 3x3 matrix s of integers in the inclusive range [1, 9]. We can convert any digit a to any other digit b in the range [1, 9] at cost of |a -b|. Given s, convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.

## [Between Two Sets](https://github.com/tknbr/hackerrank/blob/master/between_two_sets.cc)

You will be given two arrays of integers and asked to determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:
1. The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
2. he integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array

This repository will contain my C++ implementations of the problems presented in [Hackerrank](www.hackerrank.com)

## [Forming a Magic Square](https://github.com/tknbr/hackerrank/blob/master/Problem%20Solving/magicSquares.cc)

We define a magic square to be an NxN matrix of distinct positive integers from 1 to n^2 where the sum of any row, column, or diagonal of length n is always equal to the same number: the magic constant.
You will be given a 3x3 matrix s of integers in the inclusive range [1, 9]. We can convert any digit a to any other digit b in the range [1, 9] at cost of |a -b|. Given s, convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.

## [Between Two Sets](https://github.com/tknbr/hackerrank/blob/master/Problem%20Solving/between_two_sets.cc)

You will be given two arrays of integers and asked to determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:
1. The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
2. he integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array

## [Breaking the records](https://github.com/tknbr/hackerrank/blob/master/Problem%20Solving/breaking_the_records.cc)

Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.
For example, assume her scores for the season are represented in the array scores = [12, 24, 10, 24]. Scores are in the same order as the games played.
Given Maria's scores for a season, find and print the number of times she breaks her records for most and least points scored during the season.

## [Breaking the records](https://github.com/tknbr/hackerrank/blob/master/Problem%20Solving/birthday_chocolate.cc)

Lily has a chocolate bar that she wants to share it with Ron for his birthday. Each of the squares has an integer on it. She decides to share a contiguous segment of the bar selected such that the length of the segment matches Ron's birth month and the sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birth day. You must determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.
